Prior research found that Americans born in 6 southeastern states (the AF-risk  zone) had elevated risk of AF-related mortality, but no mechanisms were  identified. We hypothesized the association between AF-related mortality and  AF-risk zone birth is explained by indicators of childhood social disadvantage  or adult risk factors. In 24,323 participants in the US Health and Retirement  Study, we found that birth in the AF-risk zone was significantly associated with  hazard of AF-related mortality. Among whites, the relationship was specific to  place of birth, rather than place of adult residence. Neither paternal education  nor subjectively assessed childhood SES predicted AF-related mortality.  Conventional childhood and adult cardiovascular risk factors did not explain the  association between place of birth and AF-related mortality.
