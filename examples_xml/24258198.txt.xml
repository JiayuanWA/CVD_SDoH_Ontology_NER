BACKGROUND: Research has shown network social capital associated with a range of  health behaviours and conditions. Little is known about what social capital  inequalities in health represent, and which social factors contribute to such  inequalities. METHODS: Data come from the Montreal Neighbourhood Networks and Healthy Aging  Study (n=2707). A position generator was used to collect network data on social  capital. Health outcomes included self-reported health (SRH), physical  inactivity, and hypertension. Social capital inequalities in low SRH, physical  inactivity, and hypertension were decomposed into demographic, socioeconomic,  network and psychosocial determinants. The percentage contributions of each in  explaining health disparities were calculated. RESULTS: Across the three outcomes, higher educational attainment contributed  most consistently to explaining social capital inequalities in low SRH (%  C=30.8%), physical inactivity (15.9%), and hypertension (51.2%). Social  isolation, contributed to physical inactivity (11.7%) and hypertension (18.2%).  Sense of control (24.9%) and perceived cohesion (11.5%) contributed to low SRH.  Age reduced or increased social capital inequalities in hypertension depending  on the age category. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions that include strategies to reduce socioeconomic  inequalities and increase actual and perceived social connectivity may be most  successful in reducing social capital inequalities in health.
