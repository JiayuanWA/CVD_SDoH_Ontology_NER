The social determinants of health (SDH) are recognized as a prominent influence  on health outcomes across the lifespan. Racism is identified as a key SDH. In  this article, the authors describe the concept of racism as an SDH, its impact  in discriminatory actions and inactions, and the implications for cardiovascular  nurses. Although research in Canada on the links among racism, stress, and  cardiovascular disease is limited, there is growing evidence about the stress of  racism and its long-term impact on cardiovascular health. The authors discuss  how cardiovascular nursing could be enhanced through an understanding of  racism-related stress, and race-based differences in cardiovascular care. The  authors conclude with strategies for action to address this nursing concern.
