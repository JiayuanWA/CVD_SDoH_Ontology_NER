INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death among  US women, accounting for 25% of all deaths in this population. Approximately 65%  of these deaths occur in asymptomatic women. Hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,  and diabetes mellitus (diabetes) are major risk factors for CVD and can be  treated effectively if identified at an early stage. METHODS: Data were available from 3,572 uninsured first-time female participants  aged 40 to 65 years, referred by their health professional to the South Carolina  Well-Integrated Screening and Evaluation for Women Across the Nation (SC  WISEWOMAN), 2009-2012. All women completed a structured health-risk and behavior  questionnaire. Anthropometric measures were recorded and data on clinical  risk-factors were collected. Prevalence-ratios (PRs) were obtained by predictive  multivariable log-linear modeling. RESULTS: The prevalence of risk factors was 34.7% for uncontrolled hypertension,  9.3% for hypercholesterolemia, and 21% for diabetes. Prevalence of untreated  hypertension was 15.6%; hypercholesterolemia, 8%; and diabetes, 4%. The greatest  significant predictor of hypercholesterolemia was hypertension (PR = 4.37) and  vice versa (PR = 2.39). The greatest significant predictors of diabetes were  obesity (PR = 2.23), family history of diabetes (PR = 2.02), and  hypercholesterolemia (PR = 1.85). Being obese (PR = 1.36), overweight (PR =  1.23), aged 60 years or more (PR = 1.26), and black (PR = 1.14) were significant  predictors of having at least one CVD risk factor. Being black (PR = 1.09) was  the only significant predictor of having comorbid conditions. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of uncontrolled CVD risk factors was high among  participants in the SC WISEWOMAN program. These findings confirm that the  program is reaching high-risk women who are in need of interventions to reduce  their risk for CVD through lifestyle changes.
