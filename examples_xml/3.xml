African American (AA) women are nearly twice as likely as non-Hispanic White  (NHW) women to develop atherosclerosis associated with cardiovascular disease.  Compelling evidence demonstrates that stress-related biomarkers, such as heat  shock protein-70 (HSP70), are associated with increased atherosclerosis risk.  Yet little is known about how social factors such as perceived discrimination,  subjective social status, and socioeconomic status contribute to the levels of  these biomarkers in women with atherosclerosis. The aims of this pilot study  were to (1) describe perceived everyday discrimination, subjective social  status, perceived stress, and HSP70 level in AA and NHW women diagnosed with  coronary or carotid artery disease requiring intervention and (2) determine the  extent to which perceived discrimination, subjective social status, and  perceived stress are associated with HSP70 level, controlling for age,  education, and race. The sample for this cross-sectional, descriptive pilot  study consisted of 10 AA and 21 NHW women admitted to the hospital for elective  percutaneous cardiac intervention or carotid endarterectomy. Participants  completed questionnaires measuring psychosocial variables and provided blood  samples for analysis of HSP70. Race, age, education, perceived stress, perceived  discrimination, and subjective social status significantly (p = .022) explained  34% of the variance in HSP70 levels. However, only subjective social status (p =  .031) and AA race (p = .031) were significant independent predictors of HSP70  levels, with lower subjective social status and AA race associated with higher  HSP70. Although larger studies are needed to confirm these results, findings  imply that race and subjective social status may play an important role in  predicting stress biomarker levels.
