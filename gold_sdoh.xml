BACKGROUND: Growing spatial social and economic polarisation may be an important  societal determinant of health, but only a few studies have used the recently  developed Index of Concentration at the Extremes (ICE) to analyse the impact of  joint concentrations of privilege and privation on health outcomes. We explore  use of the ICE to investigate risk of hypertension in an urban,  multiracial/ethnic, and predominantly working-class study population of US  adults. METHODS: We generated novel ICE measures at the census tract level that jointly  assess extreme concentrations of both income and racial/ethnic composition. We  then linked the ICE measures to data from two observational, cross-sectional  studies conducted in the Boston metropolitan area (2003-2004; 2008-2010;  N=2145). RESULTS: The ICE measure for extreme concentrations of white compared with black  residents was independently associated with lower odds of hypertension (OR=0.76;  95% CI 0.62 to 0.93), controlling for race/ethnicity, age, gender, smoking, body  mass index, household income, education and self-reported exposure to racial  discrimination. Even stronger associations were observed for the ICE measures  that compared concentrations of high-income white residents versus low-income  residents of colour (OR=0.61; 95% CI 0.40 to 0.96) and high-income white versus  low-income black residents (OR=0.48; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.81). CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest public health studies should explore the joint  impact of racial/ethnic and economic spatial polarisation on population health.
