Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major contributor to the growing public health  epidemic in chronic diseases. Much of the disease and disability burden from  CVDs are in people younger than the age of 70 years in low- and middle-income  countries, formerly "the developing world." The risk of CVD is heavily  influenced by environmental conditions and lifestyle variables. In this article  we review the scope of the CVD problem in low- and middle-income countries,  including economic factors, risk factors, at-risk groups, and explanatory  frameworks that hypothesize the multifactorial drivers. Finally, we discuss  current and potential interventions to reduce the burden of CVD in vulnerable  populations including research needed to evaluate and implement promising  solutions for those most at risk.
